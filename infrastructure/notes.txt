Pass TF S3 Bucket META DATA into Pipeline to determine if any state changes needed

CI/CD should do Terraform Plan + Apply

2. Task Definition Health Check

3. Create and Obtain Cert after domain is obtained

Fargate Cost Optimization

Hit the ALB URL, make sure public 

HTTPS:
ALB DNS name only supports HTTP by default
For HTTPS, you'll need an SSL certificate
When you get your domain, use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

CORS:
Ensure your ECS tasks' CORS configuration allows the ALB DNS name
Update CORS when you add your domain later


Get your domain name first
Request a certificate in ACM for your domain
Validate the certificate (usually through DNS validation)
Once validated, you'll get the certificate ARN
For now, since you don't have a certificate yet, I recommend:
Either comment out the HTTPS listener temporarily
Or modify the HTTP listener to forward traffic instead of redirecting to HTTPS
